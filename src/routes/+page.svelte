    <h2>About Jim</h2>
    <p>
      Jim O’Connor is an American actor living in Tokyo. He received his BFA in Acting from the University
      of Rhode Island (’87), studying the Meisner Method, then worked in regional theatre under Tony
      Award–winning director Adrian Hall before moving to New York, where he worked in daytime soap operas,
      feature films and national commercials.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued training with Gary Swanson, a first-generation pupil of Lee Strasberg and lifetime member
      of The Actor’s Studio — that’s the root of the work Jim teaches today.
